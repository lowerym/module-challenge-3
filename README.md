# Module Challenge #3

## Description

For this third challenge, we had to create a password generator using JavaScript. The HTML, CSS, and JS code were provided to us, but we had to build out the JS functionality. We had to add functionality so that the user could choose how many characters long the password would be and if it should include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. I added variables to store every letter of the alphabet, both upper and lowercase, a series of numbers, and several special characters. When the user clicks "Generate Password," a prompt appears asking them to enter a number between 8 and 128. If they enter a number lower than 8 or more than 128, the prompt generates an error message. Based on random math generators, the code chooses random characters to add to the password based on what the user chooses. For instance, if they click "Ok" when prompted about numbers, the code will add random numbers to the password. Also, there's a special line of code added to prevent the prompts from looping infinitely. After the user has chosen what characters they want in the password, the code generates the password into the text window in the middle of the screen.
