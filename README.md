# Module Challenge #3

## Description

For this second challenge, we had to create a password generator using JavaScript. The HTML, CSS, and JS code were provided to us, but we had to build out the JS functionality. We had to add functionality so that the user could choose how many characters long the password would be and if it should include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
